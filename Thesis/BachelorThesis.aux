\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The digital age has fully absorbed our societies. We do everything in some form or another on digital media: create art, science, communicate, create and share memories, play games, and write thesis reports with our computers. There is basically no limit to what people do with their computers.}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Proportional to this growth, the internet's influence on our lives has also ballooned. Our activities have been pushed more and more online, and onto "the cloud." Originally, few bothered to think about privacy. Most damaging, perhaps, was the erroneous expectation of private communication. Edward Snowden's revelations about the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and their the collection of all online communication, social media, and phone data removed any doubt about expectations to individual privacy. No online communication, or online activities in general, has been considered safe ever since.}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.1}Background}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The the sphere of email communication, PGP has existed for decades. It is predicated on the exchange of user created public (and private) keys. However, it has a few inherent problems. First, there is a technical requirement to create and exchange keys. In order to facilitate this, additional client software must be installed. Additionally, several challenging steps beyond the scope of the average end user will need to be completed, like selecting encryption algorithm, size of key, etcetra. Originally, Thunderbird relied on an add-on, Enigmail, to create, manage, and exchange keys. The author used this add-on for many years. And, while it was satisfactory, it was plain to see that it was not without it's technical requirements.}{6}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Starting with Thunderbird 78, Mozilla implemented OpenPGP as part of it's core client software, and dropped support for all add-ons not using MailExtensions (which includes Enigmail). However, the feature is disabled by default, and is still considered a work in progress. All other add-ons found on Thunderbird's extensions page or searching through Github were considered to be in a testing or experimental phase.}{6}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.2}Problem}{6}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Mozilla has tried to support end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for a long time, it has been faced with a major obstacles, mostly mentioned above, including:}{6}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Thus, the problem: How can Alice send an encrypted email to someone that does not have any type of public key available?}{6}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.3}Solution}{7}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The bachelor thesis candidate intends to research and develop a Thunderbird Add-on, that will allow Alice to send an encrypted message to Bob. Bob is not a tech savvy person, and is clueless about encryption technology. So, the idea of learning, installing, and setting up any types of keys, for him, is overwhelming. However, they do communicate regularly, so Alice can just whisper a one time password to him. Subsequently, Alice could then use developed add-on to encipher an email message for Bob. Which, he then could decipher using the same add-on, and the analog agreed upon passphrase.}{7}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{More specifically, it will focus on the Mozilla Thunderbird client, for the simple fact that I have personally used it for over ten years, it's free, open-source, and cross platform. While I grant that not everyone uses Thunderbird, at least there should be no shortage of users, and theoretically anyone can get it easily, for free.}{7}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Ultimately, this project aims to offer a simple, albeit \emph  {not} perfect solution for those interested in privacy, that don't have the technical expertise to engage in key creation, exchanges or have zero knowledge about encryption. The author will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of various implementations strategies, and implement a solution that offers, hopefully, a viable encryption option that will fulfill some use cases.}{7}{}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Selecting an algorithm, among so many, was pretty straightforward given my use case, but I wanted to show my thought processes.

\citation{DelfsKnebl}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The foundation of AES is grounded in Abstract mathematics, more specifically, \emph  {set theory}. Within set theory, is the study of groups. A group is a set of elements upon which an operation (and its inverse) can be executed.}{12}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{In short, basic mathematical operations}{12}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{are operations that can be applied to a group of elements.}{12}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{A field is an extension of a group, in that all four basic arithmetic operations are included in a single structure.}{12}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{However, as cryptographers, we are not yet satisfied. We need a working set that is finite, or as they are commonly known \emph  {Galois fields}, or \emph  {unendliche Körpe}. In short, the purpose of these fields is that the set of elements, regardless of the four principle operations performed on them, the result will remain \emph  {within} the set of elements. This is profound, necessary and brilliant for cryptographic usage. But, how does this work?}{12}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Essentially, the operations are carried out with the aid of the \emph  {modulo operator}, and it ensures our result remains in the set. But, what set?}{12}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{We extend beyond a finite field, to focus on a extension field, in particular:}{12}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{As this conveniently translates to 256 elements, which is perfect for a computer byte.}{12}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The last thing we will want to have in mind as we proceed is polynomial division. It's not any different than grammar school algebra, but is carried out with one of a very special type of polynomial, known as a \emph  {irreducible polynomial}. An irreducible polynomial is similar to a prime number, only it is a polynomial. In other words, it cannot be broken down, divided down, into smaller components. For our cryptographic purposes, the polynomial we'll use is the following: $X8 + X4 + X3 + X + 1$}{13}{}\protected@file@percent }
