\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The developer describes the steps in researching and developing a Thunderbird Add-on that offers E2EE, without the need for key changes, i.e. without PGP. The developed software will allow one user to exchange a keyword/password with another user, encipher a message with that keyword/password, and the other user will be able do decipher to message with that password.}{5}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The digital age has fully absorbed our societies. We do everything in some form or another of digital media: create art, science, communicate, create and share memories, play games, and write thesis reports with our computers. There is basically no limit to what people do with their computers.}{7}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Proportional to this growth, the internet's influence on our lives has also ballooned. Our activities have been pushed more and more online, onto the cloud. Originally, few bothered to think about privacy. Most damaging, perhaps, was the erroneous expectation of private communication. Edward Snowden's revelations about the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, and cooperation in the collection of all online communication, social media, and phone data. No online communication has been considered safe ever since.}{7}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.1}Problem}{7}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Mozilla has tried to support end-to-end encryption (E2EE? for a long time, it has been faced with a major obstacles:}{7}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Thus, the problem: How can Alice send an encrypted email to someone that does not have any type of public key available?}{8}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.2}Context}{8}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{While PGP has existed for years, it is predicated on the exchange of public keys. In clear text, there is a technical requirement to create and exchange keys, and installation of any additional required client software that most average users do not have the patience to complete. Originally, Thunderbird relied on an add-on, Enigmail, to create, manage, and exchange keys.}{8}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Starting with Thunderbird 78, Mozilla implemented OpenPGP as part of it's core client software, and dropped support for all add-ons not using MailExtensions (which includes Enigmail). However, the feature is disabled by default, and is still considered a work in progress. All other add-ons found on Thunderbird's extensions page or searching through Github were considered to be in a testing or experimental phase.}{8}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.3}My solution to the problem}{8}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{This project will implement of an Email Add-on that will allow end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication. More specifically, it will focus on the Mozilla Thunderbird client, for the simple fact that I have personally used it for over ten years, it's free, open-source, and cross platform. While I grant that not everyone uses Thunderbird, at least there should be no shortage of users, and theoretically anyone can get it easily, for free.}{8}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Ultimately, this project aims to offer a simple, albeit \emph  {not} perfect solution for those interested in privacy, that don't have the technical expertise to engage in key creation, exchanges or have zero knowledge about encryption. The \author  {Esteban Licea} will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of various implementations strategies, and implement a solution that offers, hopefully, a viable encryption option that will fulfill some use cases.}{9}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The developed software product, \emph  {Thunderbird: One Time Password}, has not current rival.

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The two alternatives do have the advantage that they used symmetric key exchange to encrypt emails, which is more secure, and recommended for encoded email exchange.
