\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The digital age has fully absorbed our societies. We do everything in some form or another on digital media: create art, science, communicate, create and share memories, play games, and write thesis reports with our computers. There is basically no limit to what people do with their computers.}{4}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Proportional to this growth, the internet's influence on our lives has also ballooned. Our activities have been pushed more and more online, and onto "the cloud." Originally, few bothered to think about privacy. Most damaging, perhaps, was the erroneous expectation of private communication. Edward Snowden's revelations about the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and their the collection of all online communication, social media, and phone data removed any doubt about expectations to individual privacy. No online communication, or online activities in general, has been considered safe ever since.}{4}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.1}Background}{4}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The the sphere of email communication, PGP has existed for decades. It is predicated on the exchange of user created public (and private) keys. However, it has a few inherent problems. First, there is a technical requirement to create and exchange keys. In order to facilitate this, additional client software must be installed. Additionally, several challenging steps beyond the scope of the average end user will need to be completed, like selecting encryption algorithm, size of key, etcetra. Originally, Thunderbird relied on an add-on, Enigmail, to create, manage, and exchange keys. The author used this add-on for many years. And, while it was satisfactory, it was plain to see that it was not without it's technical requirements.}{4}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Starting with Thunderbird 78, Mozilla implemented OpenPGP as part of it's core client software, and dropped support for all add-ons not using MailExtensions (which includes Enigmail). However, the feature is disabled by default, and is still considered a work in progress. All other add-ons found on Thunderbird's extensions page or searching through Github were considered to be in a testing or experimental phase.}{4}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.2}Problem}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Mozilla has tried to support end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for a long time, it has been faced with a major obstacles, mostly mentioned above, including:}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Thus, the problem: How can Alice send an encrypted email to someone that does not have any type of public key available?}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.3}Solution}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The bachelor thesis candidate intends to research and develop a Thunderbird Add-on, that will allow Alice to send an encrypted message to Bob. Bob is not a tech savvy person, and is clueless about encryption technology. So, the idea of learning, installing, and setting up any types of keys, for him, is overwhelming. However, they do communicate regularly, so Alice can just whisper a one time password to him. Subsequently, Alice could then use developed add-on to encipher an email message for Bob. Which, he then could decipher using the same add-on, and the analog agreed upon passphrase.}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{More specifically, it will focus on the Mozilla Thunderbird client, for the simple fact that I have personally used it for over ten years, it's free, open-source, and cross platform. While I grant that not everyone uses Thunderbird, at least there should be no shortage of users, and theoretically anyone can get it easily, for free.}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Ultimately, this project aims to offer a simple, albeit \emph  {not} perfect solution for those interested in privacy, that don't have the technical expertise to engage in key creation, exchanges or have zero knowledge about encryption. The author will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of various implementations strategies, and implement a solution that offers, hopefully, a viable encryption option that will fulfill some use cases.}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The foundation of AES is grounded in Abstract mathematics, more specifically, \emph  {set theory}. Within set theory exists the study of groups.

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{There were many challenge encountered, especially at the start. First, the author wanted to work through the four available Thunderbird add-on development tutorials. There was only one problem, after two simple "hello world" type tutorials, the last two did not work, as expected. A week or so of trying to figure it out -- far too long -- I finally asked for help. There were bugs! Thus, I became acquinted with the Mozilla bug tracker, \emph  {Bugzilla}. Even though Thunderbird is considered to be an agnostic piece of software, that should work in Windows, Linux and Apple computer, it is not always the case. Apparently, development is chiefly done in Windows, and bugs for other systems are worked out over time. One of the most helpful developers, helpful to me on this journey, John Bieling, mentioned that he himself used Windows, and that he did not even have access to a Apple computer to debug some of the issues.}{17}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{My preferred platform is Apple OS, followed closely by Linux Mint. Lastly, if I have to, I will use Windows, which is what I had to use for this project. Even though sometimes during this process, I would revert to Apple or Linux platforms, ultimately, I came to the grim realization that it not advisable, because I could code something -- 100\% as it should be -- and it wouldn't work.}{17}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {4.3}Nice to Haves - Backlog}{17}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{There were many areas where the developer failed, in one regard or another. In some cases, it was simply a juvenile and painful oversight at the start. There were many components that should have been included in the original specifications that the developer simply did not consider. This included common features of email clients that were completely overlooked:}{17}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{If time allows, I will correct some of these elements.}{18}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Which brings me to my second failure, of sorts. During the development process, I saw things that were not part of the original specifications, that could be considered "very nice to have" components. I could go back and change the specifications, and add these components -- and I will add them if \emph  {time} allows. But, I want to stay genuine and committed to the specifications, and fulfill them before getting bogged down with "nice to have" features. For the time being the developer will add them to a backlog, and work on them up until the project is submitted, and thereafter, as ultimately, the project will serve not only as an academic exercise, but a development example by the author.}{18}{}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{In an ideal situation, I would have liked to to implemented "an HTW AES javascript crypto suite." However, the author was lacking to conditions. One, a team of likely three students would have been required to carry out the project in the required timeframe.

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Secondly, the students working as a team would have had to work together in the past, be known to each other, and have a nice blend of talents, motivations, and personalities for it to work efficiently.}{19}{}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The developed software product, \emph  {Thunderbird: One Time Password}, has not current rival. It current alternatives would be Mozilla's own implementation of OpenPGP. The previous option was PgP through the add-on Enigmail. However, at the writing of this document, the add-on is no longer supported.}{21}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The two alternatives do have the advantage that they used symmetric key exchange to encrypt emails, which is more secure, and recommended for encoded email exchange. The \emph  {Thunderbird: One Time Password} add-on will have the feature that it is easy to use, at the expense of security.}{21}{}\protected@file@percent }
