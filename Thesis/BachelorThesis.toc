\contentsline {paragraph}{The developer describes the steps in researching and developing a Thunderbird Add-on that offers E2EE, without the need for key changes, i.e. without PGP. The developed software will allow one user to exchange a keyword/password with another user, encipher a message with that keyword/password, and the other user will be able do decipher to message with that password.}{5}%
\contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {1}Introduction}{7}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The digital age has fully absorbed our societies. We do everything in some form or another of digital media: create art, science, communicate, create and share memories, play games, and write thesis reports with our computers. There is basically no limit to what people do with their computers.}{7}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Proportional to this growth, the internet's influence on our lives has also ballooned. Our activities have been pushed more and more online, onto the cloud. Originally, few bothered to think about privacy. Most damaging, perhaps, was the erroneous expectation of private communication. Edward Snowden's revelations about the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, and cooperation in the collection of all online communication, social media, and phone data. No online communication has been considered safe ever since.}{7}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.1}Problem}{7}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Mozilla has tried to support end-to-end encryption (E2EE? for a long time, it has been faced with a major obstacles:}{7}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Thus, the problem: How can Alice send an encrypted email to someone that does not have any type of public key available?}{8}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.2}Context}{8}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{While PGP has existed for years, it is predicated on the exchange of public keys. In clear text, there is a technical requirement to create and exchange keys, and installation of any additional required client software that most average users do not have the patience to complete. Originally, Thunderbird relied on an add-on, Enigmail, to create, manage, and exchange keys.}{8}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Starting with Thunderbird 78, Mozilla implemented OpenPGP as part of it's core client software, and dropped support for all add-ons not using MailExtensions (which includes Enigmail). However, the feature is disabled by default, and is still considered a work in progress. All other add-ons found on Thunderbird's extensions page or searching through Github were considered to be in a testing or experimental phase.}{8}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.3}My solution to the problem}{8}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{This project will implement of an Email Add-on that will allow end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication. More specifically, it will focus on the Mozilla Thunderbird client, for the simple fact that I have personally used it for over ten years, it's free, open-source, and cross platform. While I grant that not everyone uses Thunderbird, at least there should be no shortage of users, and theoretically anyone can get it easily, for free.}{8}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Ultimately, this project aims to offer a simple, albeit \emph {not} perfect solution for those interested in privacy, that don't have the technical expertise to engage in key creation, exchanges or have zero knowledge about encryption. The \author {Esteban Licea} will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of various implementations strategies, and implement a solution that offers, hopefully, a viable encryption option that will fulfill some use cases.}{9}%

\contentsline {paragraph}{The methods and tools used to solve this research inquiry will include:}{9}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{After the research has been completed, all coding will proceed using a test driven development approach. Thunderbird Add-ons are based on MailExtension technology, which are created using the follow standard languages:}{9}%

\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.1}Symmetric key encryption}{11}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Selecting an algorithm, among so many, was pretty straightforward given my use case, but I wanted to show my thought processes. Firstly, there are two fundamental paths for selecting an encryption algorithm. The selection between \emph {asymmetric} and \emph {symmetric} key encryption is the initial decision.}{11}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The goal of this project is \emph {ease of use} (at the cost of security), so our choice is clear: symmetric-key encryption.}{12}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.2}Block vs. Stream cipher encryption}{12}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Next, we need to decide between a block cipher or a stream cipher. As Bruce Schneier defines the two in his book "Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms in C" as:}{12}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The advantages of a stream ciphers:}{12}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{are more appropriate for hardware implementations.}{12}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{According to Bruce Schneier, block ciphers are more suitable for software implementation as they are easier to implement, avoid time-consuming bit manipulations, and operate on computer sized blocks.}{12}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.3}Block cipher selection}{12}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{There are many block ciphers to choose from, these are just some of the most popular:}{12}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{But, after an overall account of the block enciphers available, the author decided there is really only one reasonable choice: the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This decision is based }{13}%

\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {6.1.2}Scope}{21}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The name for this product will be "Thunderbird: One Time Password." This product will be a Thunderbird add-on, that will encipher plain text into cipher text, which will be delivered by the Thunderbird client to another Thunderbird recipient, that also has the add-on installed. Finally, the second person will be able to decipher the cipher text back to plain text, and read the message.}{21}%

\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {6.2.1}Product perspective}{23}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The developed software product, \emph {Thunderbird: One Time Password}, has not current rival. It current alternatives would be Mozilla's own implementation of OpenPGP. The previous option was PgP through the add-on Enigmail. However, at the writing of this document, the add-on is no longer supported.}{23}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The two alternatives do have the advantage that they used symmetric key exchange to encrypt emails, which is more secure, and recommended for encoded email exchange. The \emph {Thunderbird: One Time Password} add-on will have the feature that it is easy to use, at the expense of security.}{23}%
