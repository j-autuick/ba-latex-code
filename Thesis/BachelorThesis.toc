\contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {1}Introduction}{5}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The digital age has fully absorbed our societies. We do everything in some form or another on digital media: create art, science, communicate, create and share memories, play games, and write thesis reports with our computers. There is basically no limit to what people do with their computers.}{5}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Proportional to this growth, the internet's influence on our lives has also ballooned. Our activities have been pushed more and more online, and onto "the cloud." Originally, few bothered to think about privacy. Most damaging, perhaps, was the erroneous expectation of private communication. Edward Snowden's revelations about the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and their the collection of all online communication, social media, and phone data removed any doubt about expectations to individual privacy. No online communication, or online activities in general, has been considered safe ever since.}{5}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.1}Background}{5}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The the sphere of email communication, PGP has existed for decades. It is predicated on the exchange of user created public (and private) keys. However, it has a few inherent problems. First, there is a technical requirement to create and exchange keys. In order to facilitate this, additional client software must be installed. Additionally, several challenging steps beyond the scope of the average end user will need to be completed, like selecting encryption algorithm, size of key, etcetra. Originally, Thunderbird relied on an add-on, Enigmail, to create, manage, and exchange keys. The author used this add-on for many years. And, while it was satisfactory, it was plain to see that it was not without it's technical requirements.}{6}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Starting with Thunderbird 78, Mozilla implemented OpenPGP as part of it's core client software, and dropped support for all add-ons not using MailExtensions (which includes Enigmail). However, the feature is disabled by default, and is still considered a work in progress. All other add-ons found on Thunderbird's extensions page or searching through Github were considered to be in a testing or experimental phase.}{6}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.2}Problem}{6}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Mozilla has tried to support end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for a long time, it has been faced with a major obstacles, mostly mentioned above, including:}{6}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Thus, the problem: How can Alice send an encrypted email to someone that does not have any type of public key available?}{6}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.3}Solution}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The bachelor thesis candidate intends to research and develop a Thunderbird Add-on, that will allow Alice to send an encrypted message to Bob. Bob is not a tech savvy person, and is clueless about encryption technology. So, the idea of learning, installing, and setting up any types of keys, for him, is overwhelming. However, they do communicate regularly, so Alice can just whisper a one time password to him. Subsequently, Alice could then use developed add-on to encipher an email message for Bob. Which, he then could decipher using the same add-on, and the analog agreed upon passphrase.}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{More specifically, it will focus on the Mozilla Thunderbird client, for the simple fact that I have personally used it for over ten years, it's free, open-source, and cross platform. While I grant that not everyone uses Thunderbird, at least there should be no shortage of users, and theoretically anyone can get it easily, for free.}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Ultimately, this project aims to offer a simple, albeit \emph {not} perfect solution for those interested in privacy, that don't have the technical expertise to engage in key creation, exchanges or have zero knowledge about encryption. The author will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of various implementations strategies, and implement a solution that offers, hopefully, a viable encryption option that will fulfill some use cases.}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Research will dictate the best implementation strategy.}{7}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.4}Methods applied}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The methods and tools used to solve this research inquiry will include:}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{After the research has been completed, all coding will proceed using a test driven development approach. Thunderbird add-ons are based on MailExtension technology, which are created using the follow standard languages:}{8}{}%

\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2.1}Algorithm selection overview}{9}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.1}Symmetric key encryption}{9}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Selecting an algorithm, among so many, was pretty straightforward given my use case, but I wanted to show my thought processes. Firstly, there are two fundamental paths for selecting an encryption algorithm. The selection between \emph {asymmetric} and \emph {symmetric} key encryption is the initial decision.}{9}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The goal of this project is \emph {ease of use} (at the cost of security), so our choice is clear: symmetric-key encryption.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.2}Block vs. Stream cipher encryption}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Next, we need to decide between a block cipher or a stream cipher. As Bruce Schneier defines the two in his book "Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms in C" as:}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The advantages of a stream ciphers:}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{are more appropriate for hardware implementations.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{According to Bruce Schneier, block ciphers are more suitable for software implementation as they are easier to implement, avoid time-consuming bit manipulations, and operate on computer sized blocks.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.3}Block cipher selection}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{There are many block ciphers to choose from, these are just some of the most popular:}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{But, after an overall account of the block enciphers available, the author decided there is really only one reasonable choice: the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This decision is based }{11}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2.2}Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)}{11}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{AES is basically the only choice for a block cipher . It has been the industry standard for the past 20 years, even used by the U.S. government.}{11}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{For that reason, the algorithm is built into modern CPU microcode, by both AMD and Intel, for even faster processing.}{11}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.1}Mathematics: Overview}{11}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Since a full background is beyond the scope of this project (it could entail it's own thesis), the author will gloss over it quickly.}{11}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The foundation of AES is grounded in Abstract mathematics, more specifically, \emph {set theory}. Within set theory, is the study of groups. A group is a set of elements upon which an operation (and its inverse) can be executed.}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{In short, basic mathematical operations}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{are operations that can be applied to a group of elements.}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{A field is an extension of a group, in that all four basic arithmetic operations are included in a single structure.}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{However, as cryptographers, we are not yet satisfied. We need a working set that is finite, or as they are commonly known \emph {Galois fields}, or \emph {unendliche KÃ¶rpe}. In short, the purpose of these fields is that the set of elements, regardless of the four principle operations performed on them, the result will remain \emph {within} the set of elements. This is profound, necessary and brilliant for cryptographic usage. But, how does this work?}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Essentially, the operations are carried out with the aid of the \emph {modulo operator}, and it ensures our result remains in the set. But, what set?}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{We extend beyond a finite field, to focus on a extension field, in particular:}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{As this conveniently translates to 256 elements, which is perfect for a computer byte.}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The last thing we will want to have in mind as we proceed is polynomial division. It's not any different than grammar school algebra, but is carried out with one of a very special type of polynomial, known as a \emph {irreducible polynomial}. An irreducible polynomial is similar to a prime number, only it is a polynomial. In other words, it cannot be broken down, divided down, into smaller components. For our cryptographic purposes, the polynomial we'll use is the following: $X8 + X4 + X3 + X + 1$}{13}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Now, that we have an reviewed all the required mathematics,}{13}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{we continue with the algorithm.}{13}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Key expansion - how?}{13}{}%

\contentsline {paragraph}{Adding the key to the mix, the longer the key the better!}{13}{}%

\contentsline {paragraph}{What happens here is the that bytes get shifted?}{13}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.4}ShiftRows or the rows are shifted}{13}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The rows are shifted..}{13}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.5}MixColums or the columns are mixed}{13}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Here, the columns are mixed in "this" manner.}{13}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.6}AddRoundKey or the key (which key, partial) is re-added}{13}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{"This" key is re-added, xor'd? Which key, back to the field.}{13}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.7}The process is repeated x number of times.}{14}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.8}AES algorithm summary}{14}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The goal of the algorithm is to insert confusion and diffusion into the field, over and over. And, the algorithm is just reversed to retrieve the plain text. The algorithm was fast in 2001, when it was introduced, but now, 20 years later, it is built into all modern desktop CPUs (at least Intel and AMD), so it's blazingly fast.}{14}{}%

\contentsline {paragraph}{In Thunderbird, all WebExtension API can be accessed through the browser.* namespace, as with Firefox, but also through the messenger.* namespace, which is a better fit for Thunderbird.}{15}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{messenger.tabs.query}{16}{}%
\contentsline {subparagraph}{The tabs API provides access to Thunderbird's tabs. In some cases, since the call is executed from where it is called from, it may be necessary to execute tabs \emph {message\_display\_action} and not from inside the tab we are looking for.}{16}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{messenger.messageDisplay.getDisplayedMessage()}{16}{}%
\contentsline {subparagraph}{the \emph {getDisplayedMessage} method of the \emph {messageDisplay API} provides access to the currently viewed message in a given tab. It returns a promise for a \emph {MessageHeader} object from the \emph {message API} with basic imformation about the message.}{16}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{messenger.messages.getFull()}{16}{}%

\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {6.2.1}Product perspective}{25}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The developed software product, \emph {Thunderbird: One Time Password}, has not current rival. It current alternatives would be Mozilla's own implementation of OpenPGP. The previous option was PgP through the add-on Enigmail. However, at the writing of this document, the add-on is no longer supported.}{25}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The two alternatives do have the advantage that they used symmetric key exchange to encrypt emails, which is more secure, and recommended for encoded email exchange. The \emph {Thunderbird: One Time Password} add-on will have the feature that it is easy to use, at the expense of security.}{25}{}%
