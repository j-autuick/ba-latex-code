\contentsline {paragraph}{First off, I need to give credit to my partner and child, who did their best to limit distractions and allow me to complete this project. Without their continued support and love, this project would have been a great deal more complicated.}{2}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Secondly, I need to give special mention to John Bieling, an adminitrative Thunderbird Developer, who gave invaluable guidance to many roadblocks and issues I had along the way. He was always able to point me in the right direction, and without his help this project would have not been completed.}{2}{}%
\contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {1}Introduction}{5}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The digital age has fully absorbed our societies. We do everything in some form or another on digital media: create art, science, communicate, create and share memories, play games, and write thesis reports with our computers. There is basically no limit to what people do with their computers.}{5}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Proportional to this growth, the internet's influence on our lives has also ballooned. Our activities have been pushed more and more online, and onto "the cloud." Originally, few bothered to think about privacy. Most damaging, perhaps, was the erroneous expectation of private communication. Edward Snowden's revelations about the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, between the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and their the collection of all online communication, social media, and phone data removed any doubt about expectations to individual privacy. No online communication, or online activities in general, has been considered safe ever since.}{5}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.1}Background}{5}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{In the realm of email communication, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) has existed for decades. It is predicated on the exchange of user created public keys (in combination with private, non-exchanged keys). However, it has a few inherent obstacles. First, there is a technical requirement to create and exchange keys. In order to facilitate this, additional client software must be installed. Additionally, several challenging steps beyond the scope of the average end user will need to be completed, like selecting encryption algorithm, size of key, etc. Originally, Thunderbird relied on an add-on, Enigmail, to create, manage, and exchange keys. The author used this add-on for many years. And, while it was satisfactory, it was plain to see that it was not without it's technical requirements.}{5}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Starting with Thunderbird 78 (2020), Mozilla implemented OpenPGP as part of its core client software, and dropped support for all add-ons not using MailExtensions (which includes Enigmail). There were a few reasons for this, including Mozilla's desire to simplify the process. But, also the desire to move away from the PGP trademarked software. Nevertheless, the OpenPGP feature is disabled by default, and is still considered a work in progress. All other encryption add-ons found on Thunderbird's extensions page or searching through Github were considered to be in a testing or experimental phase.}{6}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.2}Problem}{6}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Mozilla has tried to support end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for a long time, but it has been faced with major obstacles, partly mentioned above, including:}{6}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Thus, the problem: How can Alice send an encrypted email to someone that does not have any type of public key available?}{6}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.3}Solution}{6}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The bachelor thesis candidate intends to research and develop a Thunderbird Add-on, that will allow Alice to send an encrypted message to Bob. Bob is not a tech savvy person, and is clueless about encryption technology. So, the idea of learning, installing, and setting up any types of keys, for him, is overwhelming. However, they do communicate regularly, so Alice can just whisper a one time password to him. Subsequently, Alice could then use the developed add-on to encrypt an email message for Bob. Which, he then could decrypt using the same add-on, and the previously agreed upon password.}{6}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{This thesis will focus on the Mozilla Thunderbird client, for the simple fact that it's free, open-source, and cross platform. While I grant that not everyone uses Thunderbird, at least there should be no shortage of users, and theoretically anyone can get it easily, for free.}{6}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Ultimately, this project aims to offer a simple, albeit \emph {not} perfect solution for those interested in privacy, that don't have the technical expertise to engage in key creation, exchanges or have zero knowledge about encryption. The author will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of various implementations strategies, and implement a solution that offers, hopefully, a viable encryption option that will fulfill some use cases.}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Research will dictate the best implementation strategy.}{7}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1.4}Methods applied}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The methods and tools used to solve this research inquiry will include:}{7}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{After the research has been completed, all coding will proceed using a test driven development approach. Thunderbird add-ons are based on MailExtension technology, which are created using the follow standard languages:}{7}{}%

\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2.1}Algorithm selection overview}{8}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.1}Symmetric key encryption}{8}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Selecting an algorithm, among so many, was pretty straightforward given my use case. Firstly, there are two fundamental paths for selecting an encryption algorithm. The selection between \emph {asymmetric} and \emph {symmetric} key encryption is the initial decision.}{8}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The goal of this project is \emph {ease of use} (at the cost of security), so our choice is clear: symmetric-key encryption.}{8}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.2}Block vs. Stream cipher encryption}{8}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Next, we need to decide between a block cipher or a stream cipher. As Bruce Schneier defines the two in his book "Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms in C" as:}{8}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The advantages of a stream ciphers:}{9}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{are more appropriate for hardware implementations.}{9}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{According to Bruce Schneier, block ciphers are more suitable for software implementation as they are easier to implement, avoid time-consuming bit manipulations, and operate on computer sized blocks.}{9}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.1.3}Block cipher selection}{9}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{There are many block ciphers to choose from, these are just some of the most popular:}{9}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{After an overall account of the available block enciphers, the author decided there is really only one choice: the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as it's the industry standard.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2.2}Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{For reasons that will soon become apparent, AES has been the industry standard for the past 20 years, even used as a secure standard by the U.S. government.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.1}Mathematics: Overview}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Since a full background is beyond the scope of this project (it could entail it's own thesis), the author will gloss over it quickly.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The foundation of AES is grounded in Abstract mathematics, more specifically, \emph {set theory}. Within set theory exists the study of groups. A group is a set of elements upon which an operation (and its inverse) can be executed.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{In short,}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{are operations that can be applied to a group of elements.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{A field is an extension of a group, in that all four basic arithmetic operations are included in a single structure.}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{However, as cryptographers, we are not yet satisfied. We need a working set that is finite, or as they are commonly known \emph {Galois fields}, or \emph {endliche KÃ¶rpe}. In short, the beauty of the Galois fields is that regardless of the four principle operations performed on them, the result will remain \emph {within} the set of elements. This is profound, necessary and brilliant for cryptographic usage. But, how does this work?}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Essentially, the above operations are carried out with the aid of the \emph {modulo operator}, and it ensures our result remains in the set. But, what set?}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The Galois field principles are focused on one particular sub-field, namely the field defined by:}{10}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{This conveniently translates to 256 elements, which fits perfectly within a computer byte.}{11}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The last thing we will want to have in mind as we proceed is polynomial division. It's not any different than grammar school algebra, but is carried out with one of a very special type of polynomial, known as a \emph {irreducible polynomial}. An irreducible polynomial is similar to a prime number, only that it is a polynomial. In other words, it cannot be factored into smaller components. The AES algorithm uses the following polynomial: $x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1$}{11}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.2}The AES algorithm}{11}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{With the mathemathical theories out of the way, we can look at how all the theory get implemented into our computers. Here is a simplifed overview: (See: 2.1\hbox {}).}{11}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The first step in the AES algorithm is the creation of a 4-by-4 array of bytes called the state, that is modified in a series of rounds. The state is initially set equal to the input of the cipher (notice: a 128 bit minimum is exactly 16 bytes, perfect for execution on a computer). Then, the following four operations are applied.}{11}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.3}Step one: "AddRound" key}{11}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{In every round of the AES, a 128-bit sub-key is derived from the master key, and it is interpreted as a 4-by-4 array of bytes. The state array is updated by XORing it with the sub-key (See: 2.2\hbox {}).}{11}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.4}Step two: "SubBytes" or byte substitution}{12}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{In this step, each byte of the state array is replaced by another byte according to a single fixed table S. This substitution table (or S-box) is a bijection over $\{0,1\}^8$. There is only one S-box that is substituting all the bytes in the state array, every round (See: 2.3\hbox {}).}{12}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.5}Step three: "ShiftRows" or the rows are shifted}{13}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{In this step, the bytes in each row of the state array are cyclically shifted to the left as follows: the first row of the array is untouched, and the second row is shifted one place to the left, the third row is shifted two places to the left, and the fourth row is shifted three places to the left (See: 2.4\hbox {}).}{13}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.6}Step four: "MixColumns" or the columns are mixed}{13}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{In this step, an invertible linear transformation is applied to each column. One can think of this as a matrix multiplication (See: 2.5\hbox {}).}{13}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.7}The process is repeated x number of times}{14}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The AES algorithm supports bit sizes of 128 (minimum requirement), 192, and 256. Depending on the bit size specified, the algorithm will be repeated either 10, 12, or 14 times.}{14}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.2.8}AES algorithm summary}{14}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The goal of the algorithm is to insert confusion and diffusion into the field, over and over. And, the algorithm is just reversed to retrieve the plain text. The algorithm was fast in 2001, when it was introduced, but now, 20 years later, it is built into all modern CPUs, so it's blazingly fast.}{14}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Although the algorithm is derived from a combination of complex mathematical theories, its algorithmic implementation into hardware is the perfect intersection between mathematics and computer science. Any computer scientist can quickly assess from the images above, that the XORing, bit shifting, table lookups, and bit permutations are exactly the kind of operations that are executed super fast on computers.}{14}{}%
\contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {3}Implementation}{15}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {3.1}Javascript Cryptography}{15}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The developer decided that the best solution for the cryptography implementation was the utilization of a pre-existing cryptography library.}{15}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{For this task, there were three necessary conditions that had to be met:}{15}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{and, slightly less important, actively maintained.}{15}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Meeting the above criteria was not as simple as it would seem. There were many options that met some of the conditions, but meeting all of them was more challenging. Ultimately, however, the researcher was satisfied with the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library (SJCL), as it met all the above conditions. Additionally, it appeared to be well developed, and still actively maintained (See: 3.1\hbox {}.}{15}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The usage is uncomplicated, and will work for this implementation. The library is available in a minified version, and will be packages with the add-on:}{16}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{giving the following result (See: 3.2\hbox {}):}{16}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{This usage will meet our needs.}{16}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {3.2}WebExtensions}{16}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{WebExtensions are web technologies built with the tools that are natural to any web developer: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Each extension must have a \emph {manifest.json} file, which essentially holds all the vital information like the author of the software, permissions required to use the add-on, the software version, and so on.}{16}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Starting with the release of Thunderbird version 68 (August 2019), Thunderbird moved to only support WebExtensions for add-ons and themes development, with all previous versions no longer working. Even the long standing Enigmail cryptography add-on that the author used for years, no longer functioned.}{16}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Here is an image from Mozilla's Thunderbird Add-on Webpage that gives a quick glance of how the extensions might look like (See: 3.3\hbox {}.}{16}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {3.3}Implementation Details}{17}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {3.3.1}Developer Tools}{17}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{For this project, the developer used a Test Driven Development model to go step-by-step through each implemented item. This allows for immediate checking if something works or not, and enhancement of the code in an incremental way. Most every step will be sent to the console.log, to verify success or failure. The first invaluable tool was Tunderbird's mail client Developer Toolkit, which shows a great deal of information, and includes the console. It was an excellent tool which helped with debugging, and seeing what was working and not working through each step (See: 3.4\hbox {}). The developer had it open at all times. Note: Not incidentally, it looks like a typical web browsers developer toolkit, since Thunderbird's core is based on Web Extension technology.}{17}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The second valuable tool was the communication channel Element. It an excellent channel to ask questions to other Thunderbird developers. It was where I found answers to most issues that I had (See: 3.5\hbox {}).}{18}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{As mentioned in the acknowledgements, John Bieling was always able to point me in the right direction, within a reasonably short period of time. So, this type of quick responses were paramount to getting the author back on track.}{18}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The third valuable resource gained during the development process was a Github repository that had many sample extensions. The examples that provided the most help are listed below:}{18}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {3.3.2}Creating a compose window encryption button}{19}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{First, we'll create a button that will appear in the "Compose Window," the window that appears when you start to write an email.}{19}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Before add-on implementation: (See: 3.6\hbox {})}{19}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{with add-on button implemented (See: 3.10\hbox {}).}{19}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{And, here is the manifest.json file that was created for this button. Most of the references in the manifest.json file are self-explanatory. One thing to note about the manifest file is the version number. It has to be set to 2. The rest is composed of information about the add-on, location of images used, and the permissions required for the add-on to function, which is not insignificant. Different permissions are required to access different areas of the user interface, e.g. the compose window, browser window, messages, modifyMessages, etc. (See reference figure: 3.8\hbox {}).}{20}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {3.3.3}Prompt for password}{20}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Managing the password was an early obstacle encountered. Namely, the developer was put on notice that he simply could not just use straight Javascript to get the desired results, but instead had to work within the context of Mozilla's API. So, this was an initial challenge.}{20}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{I wanted to highlight the process one time, just so it's clear. This was the process throughout. First, if necessary, the manifest.json file has to be updated. Then, the web extension files (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) should be kept orderly. But, additionally, Mozilla web extension API rules needed to be followed.}{20}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Step one: updated the manifest.json file. The developer needed to add the \emph {compose\_action} so that the button would be added on the compose window.}{21}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{But, in the code, several files needed to be created, in addition to the pop up folder. A \emph {background.js} file needed to be created. The background.js file acts, as the name suggests in the background. It is loaded when the add-on is loaded, and it is running, or shall I say, "listening" for events. The code will be available on github, but I will explain the basic process.}{21}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The background.js listeners are just waiting for the encrypt button to be clicked. This activates the pop up window, which will launch the popup.html file. (See: 3.10\hbox {}}{21}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The reader can notice how I used the Developer Toolkit, with console.log used literally throughout the development process.}{21}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {3.3.4}Encrypt the message}{21}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The challenge with the password was not simply collecting it. But, instead, it was passing the variable from the popup.html and its accompanying popup.js to the background.js. The way the API works, it wasn't as straight forward as the developer originally thought. The password had to be sent as a message, to listeners in the background.js.}{22}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Fortunately, there were some examples that were reasonably close on Mr. Bieling's github sample-extensions repo that gave me some ideas of how it could work.}{22}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The encryption was a three part process:}{22}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{After we were able to move the password variable to the background.js, we could go with step two.}{22}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{For this step, the developer loaded the minimized version of the library, which is quite small, and still powerful. This is how it was loaded into the background.js file. (See: 3.11\hbox {})}{22}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{During development, every step was sent to the console.log (later cleaned up). There are a few different elements here to take note of. Firstly, some of the elements are part of the Mozilla API, like the details.body, messenger.compose.setComposeDetails. Apparently, the messenger is the namespace used for Thunderbird, replacing what was previously used (the browser namespace).}{22}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Another interesting component is the actual execution of the encryption, by the SJCL.}{22}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{It's usage is simple, it takes two arguments, one with a password, and another with the text to be encrypted.}{23}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The expected and natural behavior for a user is for them to write an email, then click on the "encrypt" button, like so. (See: 3.13\hbox {}), and enter a password.}{23}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{After that, a password is entered, and the magic happens. (See: 3.14\hbox {})}{24}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Note: the console.log keeping track of where we are, and also verifying that the decryption also works with the same password. From here, the message can be sent as normal, or saved as a draft. There was some developmental pondering, if the encryption button should also send the message in one go, since it's not like the email is really able to be edited or read at this point, but for now left it as is, giving the user the option to add attachments or email recipients.}{24}{}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {3.3.5}Decrypt the Message}{24}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Now, sending the email to another account, we can see two very interesting elements.}{24}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{First, there is a "Decrypt" icon on the far right of what is known as the \emph {message\_display\_area} another UI component of the Thunderbird interface. (See: 3.15\hbox {})}{25}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{This is another required manifest.json addition, as well as updating the permissions section (See: 3.16\hbox {} \& 3.17\hbox {}).}{26}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{An interesting encryption component that has not been explained, is the way the encrypted message is displayed. Most of the encrypt text describes the protocols involved, like mode of operation (in this case, CCM, or \emph {Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code}), type of cipher used (AES), the version, etc. What leads the block, however, is important. The "iv" or the \emph {Initialization vector}. This is essentially used as a seeding value. And what is so interesting about it is: that even if a would be hacker was given the "iv" value, without the password they would be no closer to decrypting the message. (See 3.17\hbox {})}{26}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The following image displays the activation of the "decrypt button" which displays a similar pop-up window as was shown during the encryption pop-up, with the only difference between "ENCRYPT" or "DECRYPT," naturally. (See 3.17\hbox {})}{26}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Finally, in the console.log, we are able to see that from the receiving end, we are able to decrypt the emailed text when the correct password is given. (See: 3.18\hbox {})}{27}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Ultimaetly, however, the implementation was not completed. The developer wasn't not quite able to get the decrypted code to replaced the cipher code in the body of the message in a reliable way. Further development will continue to resolve this. Unfortunately, the Mozilla API is a living, breathing, in progress project, so the various elements do not behave in a uniform manner. Namely, the API that worked on the compose window did not have a corresponding message window API.}{27}{}%
\contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {4}Challenges Encountered}{28}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {4.1}Live development environment}{28}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{There were many challenges encountered, especially at the start. First, the developer wanted to work through the four available Thunderbird add-on development beginner tutorials to build an understanding of how the basics worked. There was only one problem, after two simple "hello world" level tutorials, the last two did not work. A week or so of trying to figure it out, far too long, before I finally asked for help. There were bugs. Thus, I became acquainted with the Mozilla bug tracker, \emph {Bugzilla}. Even though Thunderbird is considered to be an agnostic piece of software, that should work in Windows, Linux and Apple operating systems, it apparently is not always the case. Development is chiefly done in Windows, and bugs for other systems are worked out over time. One of the most helpful developers, John Bieling, mentioned to me that, he himself, used Windows, and that he did not even have access to a Apple computer to debug some of the issues.}{28}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The developer's preferred platform is Apple OS, followed closely by Linux Mint. However, both proved to be unreliable and I had to fallback to a Windows system, which became the system I used for this project. Even though, sometimes, during this process, I would revert to Apple or Linux platforms, ultimately, I came to the grim realization that it was not advisable, because I could code something -- 100\% as it should be -- and it wouldn't work.}{28}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {4.2}Backlog}{28}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{There were many areas where the developer's efforts were incomplete, in one regard or another. In some cases, it was simply a juvenile and painful oversight at the start. There were many components that should have been included in the original specifications that the developer simply did not consider. This included common features of email clients that were completely overlooked:}{28}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{There are a slew of other issues that only became evident to the developer \emph {after} the development process began. Small things could be immediately resolved--or turned out not to be issues at all (like handling messages that fall into the draft window). But, many other things were not included in the original specifications--so the developer stayed the course, and remained focused on meeting the minimum specified requirements, rather than stray too far in different directions.}{29}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{These are additional items that could be added, improved or enhanced in the future:}{29}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Lastly, the code needs to be re-factored to be cleaner. The developer concedes some redundancy.}{29}{}%
\contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {5}Summary}{30}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {5.1}Retrospective}{30}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{First, the developer has to acknowledge that \emph {now} he feels like he knows Mozilla's Thunderbird API. Additionally, the experience and knowledge in Javascript has expanded by leaps and bounds. So, professionally, the experience has been of significant importance for someone interesting in calling themselves a professional in internet technologies.}{30}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{This was the developer's very first full fledged project where he was not supported, by other more talented programmers. Additionally, it marked the first time that the developer worked in a real-time environment with other developers. I was not intimidated by this, at the time, because I did not know any better. Only later, when I saw developers arguing about something (stylistic), with one throwing down his "...in 40 years of software engineering experience" card, to which the respondent conceding defeat with his own "...that he only had 30+ years of software engineering experience" card. I knew then, I was swimming with the sharks. Fortunately, it came towards the end of my project.}{30}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Regrettably, the implementation is not complete. It falls just short of meeting the specifications defined by the developer at the beginning, and further short of what should be expected in a complete turn-key solution. There were a number of things that the developer did not foresee before development began which, in itself, is a failing that inhibited a robust solution.}{30}{}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {5.2}Next steps}{30}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Nevertheless, the developer intends to smooth out the project, enhance shortcomings, and use it as an example of what the developer is fully capable of. The developer can take a break from academic writing, and just focus on hacking, debugging, testing, refining, and re-factoring.}{30}{}%

\contentsline {paragraph}{The developed software product, \emph {Thunderbird: One Time Password}, has not current rival. It current alternatives would be Mozilla's own implementation of OpenPGP.

\contentsline {subsubsection}{Use Case ID}{34}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The Use Case ID will be a unique, numeric identifier for the use case.}{34}{}%
\contentsline {subsubsection}{Actor(s)}{34}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{An actor is a person or other entity external to the system who interacts with it, and performs use cases to complete task. Included in this designation, will be additional actors who participate in the use case.}{34}{}%
\contentsline {subsubsection}{Description}{34}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{This section should describe at a high level the purpose of the use case, what it aims to achieve, and any other relevant outcomes.}{34}{}%
\contentsline {subsubsection}{Preconditions}{34}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The preconditions are all those conditions that must exist prior to the execution of the use case.}{34}{}%
\contentsline {subsubsection}{Basic Flow}{34}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{These are the basic, ordered steps and the description required for the completion of the use case. The steps will be numbers, and should be executed in this exact order. Completing the steps, in this order, should lead to the completion of the use case without error.}{34}{}%
\contentsline {subsubsection}{Exceptions}{35}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Describes any anticipated errors that could occur during the execution of the use case, and how the system will handle these errors. The exceptions will not describe unanticipated errors that are not included in the basic flow.}{35}{}%
\contentsline {subsubsection}{Postconditions}{35}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{Describes the state of all relevant parties, including the system, \emph {after} the execution of the use case.}{35}{}%
