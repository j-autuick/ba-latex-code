\paragraph{The developer describes the steps in researching and developing a Thunderbird email add-on that offers End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), without the need for key changes, i.e. without Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and its asymmetric key exchange requirement. The developed software will allow a user to exchange a password with another user, encrypt a message with that password, and the other user will be able to decrypt the message with that same password.}
