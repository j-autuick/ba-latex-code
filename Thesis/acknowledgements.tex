\section{Acknowledgements}

\paragraph{First off, I need to give credit to my partner and child, who did their best to limit distractions and allow me to complete this project. Without their continued support and love, this project would have been a great deal more complicated.}

\paragraph{Secondly, I need to give special mention to John Bieling, an adminitrative Thunderbird Developer, who gave invaluable guidance to many roadblocks and issues I had along the way. He was always able to point me in the right direction, and without his help this project would have not been completed.}
