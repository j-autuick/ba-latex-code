\chapter{Summary}

\section{Retrospective}
\paragraph{In an ideal situation, I would have liked to to implemented "an HTW AES javascript crypto suite." However, the author was lacking to conditions. One, a team of likely three students would have been required to carry out the project in the required timeframe. The documentation, development, and testing of such a system would have required a great deal of teamwork.}

\paragraph{Secondly, the students working as a team would have had to work together in the past, be known to each other, and have a nice blend of talents, motivations, and personalities for it to work efficiently.}
